# Modelling-of-CPS-Project

## Assumptions

2 dof simple robotic arm, consisting of rotational joint connected with translational. Arm is about 1 meter in lenght.

## Goals

Main goal is to define two points A and B, and then to make the robot to go from A to B and then from B to A.


## Steps to follow

1. Mathematical model preparation (simplified with point mass, and no additional inertia)

- 

- 

2. Linearization in selected points

- 

- 

3. Controller selection and implementation

-

-

4. Controller optimization

5. Simscape validation
